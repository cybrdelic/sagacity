# feature: implement artifact modification and clarifications for new project setup

this ticket enables users to review and refine the generated planning artifacts, ensuring they fully align with their vision. it introduces an interactive phase for modifications and clarifications, and the system itself will generate follow-up questions to resolve ambiguities or gather additional detail when needed.

## objectives
- present generated artifacts in an organized, scrollable review interface.
- allow users to specify modifications or request clarifications for any artifact (e.g., "change directory tree: add an 'api' folder under src").
- have the system automatically generate additional clarification questions if user input is ambiguous or if certain artifacts require further detail.
- log and apply modifications, triggering re-generation of affected artifacts if necessary.
- support a final approval command ("approve") to mark the artifacts as final for project scaffolding.

## tasks

1. **create artifact_clarifications.rs:**
   - design and implement the ui to display all generated artifacts clearly and in a structured manner.
   - implement logic to capture user input for modification requests; parse commands such as "update ui/ux design: prefer minimalist style with dark mode".
   - support inline editing or re-generation triggers so that changes to an artifact can be applied immediately.
   - log every modification request with details for auditing and debugging.
   - implement a mechanism for the user to input an "approve" command to finalize all artifacts.
   - **include the following system prompt in the ui:**
     ```
     here are your generated artifacts:
     - tech stack and tools plan
     - directory tree plan
     - mvp development plan
     - requirements plan
     - user flow plan
     - (optional) project timeline & milestones
     - (optional) risk and mitigation plan
     - (optional) resource allocation & cost estimation
     - (optional) ui/ux design concept

     please list any modifications (e.g., "change directory tree: add an 'api' folder under src" or "update ui/ux design: prefer minimalist style with dark mode") or type 'approve' if all artifacts are correct.
     ```
   - additionally, implement functionality where the system:
     - analyzes each artifact for potential ambiguities or missing details.
     - automatically generates follow-up clarification questions (e.g., "do you want to include a logging folder in your directory structure?" or "should the ui/ux design concept incorporate dark mode by default?") to prompt the user for further refinement.

2. **integration:**
   - tie this module into the existing artifact generation flow so that modifications and generated clarification questions are automatically reflected in the stored artifacts.
   - update the project setup state to mark artifacts as approved once the user finalizes them.
   - ensure that error messages or additional clarification prompts are clearly displayed if user input is ambiguous or incomplete.

## expected outcome
- users can interactively review and modify planning artifacts using the dedicated modification interface.
- the system not only captures explicit modification commands but also proactively generates follow-up questions to resolve ambiguities.
- all modifications are logged and processed, with corresponding artifacts re-generated if needed.
- upon final approval, the system marks the artifacts as final and proceeds with project scaffolding.
