# feature: add tests and documentation for new project setup flow

this ticket ensures that the new project setup functionality is thoroughly tested and well-documented, supporting future maintenance and enhancements.

## objectives
- develop comprehensive unit and integration tests for all new modules (context ingestion, artifact generation, modification, ui, state management).
- update documentation to clearly describe the new project setup process and modules.
- ensure maintainability and clarity in the new codebase.

## tasks
1. **create project_setup_tests.rs:**
   - implement unit tests for context_ingestion, artifact_generation, artifact_clarifications, project_setup_ui, and state management.
   - write integration tests that simulate a full project setup flow.

2. **documentation updates:**
   - update the main documentation to include detailed descriptions of the new modules, workflows, and key events.
   - provide usage instructions and examples for developers and users.

## expected outcome
- a well-tested project setup feature with high code quality.
- comprehensive documentation that facilitates future development and debugging.
